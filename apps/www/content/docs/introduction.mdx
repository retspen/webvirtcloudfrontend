## What is WebVirtCloud?
**WebVirtCloud** is a web platform for managing virtual machines (VMs) on remote servers. It offers an alternative to platforms like DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr, allowing users to host and control their virtual machines independently.

## Why WebVirtCloud?
WebVirtCloud serves as an ideal replacement for traditional cloud providers by putting the power of virtualization directly in the hands of users. Here's why WebVirtCloud stands out:

- **Self-Hosted Solution:** By hosting WebVirtCloud on their own infrastructure, users retain full control over their data and resources, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

- **Comprehensive Features:** WebVirtCloud offers a plethora of features, including private networking, firewalls, floating IPs, backups, and snapshots. These features empower users to create and manage virtual machines with ease, fostering flexibility and scalability.

- **Virtual machine templates:** Pre-configured virtual machine templates, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Almalinux and Rocky Linux.

- **Cost Efficiency:** By eliminating the need for third-party cloud providers, WebVirtCloud significantly reduces operational costs, making it an economical choice for businesses and individuals alike.

- **Ease of Management:** The intuitive web interface of WebVirtCloud simplifies the management of virtual infrastructure, allowing users to focus on their core tasks without the complexity typically associated with traditional virtualization solutions.

In essence, WebVirtCloud empowers users to build and manage their virtual infrastructure efficiently, securely, and cost-effectively, making it the preferred choice for those seeking full control over their cloud environment.

## Features

- **User Management:** Create and manage user accounts.
- **VM Management:** Create, manage, and delete virtual machines on remote servers.
- **VM Templates:** Pre-configured templates for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, AlmaLinux, and Rocky Linux.
- **Firewall Management:** Configure firewall rules for virtual machines.
- **Floating IP Management:** Assign and manage floating IP addresses.
- **Load Balancer:** Set up and manage load balancers to distribute traffic across virtual machines.

## How it works?
WebVirtCloud consists of two main components:
- **Controller:** A web interface to manage virtual machines.
- **Compute Node:** A hypervisor that runs the virtual machines.

## Installation
Follow these guides to install controller and hypervisor:
- [Setup Controller](/docs/installation/setup-controller)
- [Setup Hypervisor](/docs/installation/setup-hypervisor)

It is recommended to install the Controller and Compute Node on separate servers.

## Multi region support
WebVirtCloud supports multi-region. You can have multiple compute nodes in different regions and manage them from the same controller.
