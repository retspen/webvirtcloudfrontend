## What is WebVirtCloud?

WebVirtCloud is a web-based, open-source virtualization platform that allows users to manage and create virtual machines on a remote server. You just need to install WebVirtCloud on a server or even your laptop or PC and you can use it to create, manage, and delete virtual machines. It is a self-hosted alternative to platforms like DigitalOcean, Linode, and Vultr. WebVirtCloud allows users to manage their virtual infrastructure efficiently and securely.

## Why WebVirtCloud?

WebVirtCloud serves as an ideal replacement for traditional cloud providers by putting the power of virtualization directly in the hands of users. Here's why WebVirtCloud stands out:

- **Self-Hosted Solution:** By hosting WebVirtCloud on their own infrastructure, users retain full control over their data and resources, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

- **Comprehensive Features:** WebVirtCloud offers a plethora of features, including private networking, firewalls, floating IPs, backups, and snapshots. These features empower users to create and manage virtual machines with ease, fostering flexibility and scalability.

- **Virtual machine templates:** Pre-configured virtual machine templates, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Almalinux and Rocky Linux.

- **Cost Efficiency:** By eliminating the need for third-party cloud providers, WebVirtCloud significantly reduces operational costs, making it an economical choice for businesses and individuals alike.

- **Ease of Management:** The intuitive web interface of WebVirtCloud simplifies the management of virtual infrastructure, allowing users to focus on their core tasks without the complexity typically associated with traditional virtualization solutions.

In essence, WebVirtCloud empowers users to build and manage their virtual infrastructure efficiently, securely, and cost-effectively, making it the preferred choice for those seeking full control over their cloud environment.

## How it works?

WebVirtCloud have two components: the controller and the compute. The controller is the web interface that allows you to manage your virtual machines. The [compute](https://github.com/webvirtcloud/webvirtcompute) is the hypervisor that runs the virtual machines.

## Multi region support

WebVirtCloud supports multi-region. You can have multiple compute nodes in different regions and manage them from the same controller.
