<Note title="Recommended setup">
  We recommend running the controller and the compute on separate servers. The controller
  can be installed on a server or even your laptop or PC. The compute should be installed
  on a server with virtualization support (e.g. KVM).
</Note>

```

### Run script for deploy

## Additional settings

You can change the default settings in the `custom.env` file. Just copy variables you want to change from the `global.env` file and change them in the `custom.env` file. Example for mail settings:

EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT = 587

EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "admin"
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_FROM = "WebVirtCloud <noreply@gmail.com>"
