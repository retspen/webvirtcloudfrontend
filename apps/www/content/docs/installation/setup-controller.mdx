title: Setup controller
description: This guide will walk you through the steps required to get your cloud platform up and running quickly. Whether you're a seasoned system administrator or a first-time user, this guide is designed to make the installation process as smooth as possible.

<Note title="Recommended setup">
  We recommend running the controller and the compute on separate servers. The controller
  can be installed on a server or even your laptop or PC. The compute should be installed
  on a server with virtualization support (e.g. KVM).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Install

<Steps>
### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webvirtcloud/webvirtcloud.git
```

### Go into the webvirtcloud directory

```bash
cd webvirtcloud
```

### Configure the Caddy server

To configure TLS for the web server, copy either the Caddyfile.selfsigned or Caddyfile.letsencrypt and without TLS Caddyfile.noncert template to Caddyfile.

NOTE: Caddy web server does not support TLS for IP address.

If you want ot use TLS connection with IP address you can use [nip.io](https://nip.io) service as a simple workaround. For example, if your IP address is `192.168.0.114`, you can use the domain name `192-168-0-114.nip.io`. In the example below, we will use the domain name `webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io` with self-signed certificates:

```bash
# Create the directory structure for Caddy certificates
mkdir -p .caddy/certs

# Generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL
openssl req -x509 \
    -newkey rsa:4096 \
    -keyout .caddy/certs/key.pem \
    -out .caddy/certs/cert.pem \
    -days 365 \
    -nodes \
    -subj "/CN=webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io"

# Copy the self-signed Caddyfile to the main Caddyfile
cp Caddyfile.selfsigned Caddyfile
```

### Run script for deploy WebVirtCloud
**NOTE:** Example for domain: `webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io`

```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh env
```

### Start WebVirtCloud

```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh start
```

- Client panel - [https://webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io](https://webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io)
- Admin panel - [https://webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io/admin](https://webvirtcloud-192-168-0-114.nip.io/admin)

### Credentials

Default credentials for admin side:
```
username: admin@webvirt.cloud
password: admin
```
You can create new user in admin side or register new user in client side.
</Steps>

## Update controller

<Steps>
### Run update script

```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh update
```
If you have installation before and want to use new features like the [Load Balancer](https://webvirt.cloud/blog/new-feature-load-balancer), you need to add new size to database:
```bash
./webvirtcloud.sh loaddata
```

<Note title="Warning">
  Don't forget update [WebVirtCompute daemon](https://webvirt.cloud/docs/installation/setup-hypervisor#update-webvirtcompute-daemon) on nodes after update controller.
</Note>

Wait until the update process finishes.

</Steps>

## Additional settings

You can change the default settings in the `custom.env` file. Just copy variables you want to change from the `global.env` file and change them in the `custom.env` file. Example for mail settings:

```bash
# Email environment variables
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=admin
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=admin
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_FROM="WebVirtCloud <noreply@gmail.com>"
```

## Load Balancer
[Load Balancer](https://webvirt.cloud/blog/new-feature-load-balancer) is a new feature in WebVirtCloud. You can create a load balancer and add virtual machines to it. The load balancer will distribute the incoming traffic to the virtual machines.

Manually enable Load Balancer for client side (only if you have installed befeore Load Balancer feature):
```bash
echo "VITE_LOADBALANCER=true" >> custom.env
```
<Note title="Important">
Load Balancer required access from controller to private network for deploy and manage HaProxy on virtual machine.
</Note>

## Compute configuration (hypervisor)
More information about the compute configuration can be found in the WebVirtCompute repository.

## Private networking
If you don't have additional network interfaces on your server for private network, you can use the [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN to create a private network between the controller and the compute.

<Note title="Warning">
  Also check [README.md](https://github.com/webvirtcloud/webvirtbackend/blob/master/README.md) which is always up-to-date.
